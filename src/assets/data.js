      "Our very own Angus Filets Mignon, from 100% Black Angus cattle raised in the Midwest heartland by a select few family-owned ranches and farms. We hand-select for a high degree of marbling and tenderness that you’ll savor and hand-cut by highly skilled butchers applying the same artisanal standards pioneered by the neighborhood butcher. All of this combined with our patented wet-aging process results in consistently exceptional flavor and texture beyond compare. Allen Brothers Angus earns some of the highest accolades of any USDA Certified Premium Beef Programs.",
